This application will get recent measurements from your NetAtmo and light up a ThingM blink(1) (http://thingm.com/products/blink-1.html) as an ambient display.

The repo also includes a daemonizer, but you must install forever (https://npmjs.org/package/forever) to use it:

```javascript
npm install forever
```

To start the daemon, use:

```javascript
forever start atmo_daemon.js
```
